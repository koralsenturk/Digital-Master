# Digital Master (Dijital Usta)

Digital Master is an Applied AI concept focused on transforming real-world human expertise, field knowledge, and procedural know-how into **explainable, controllable, and auditable decision systems**.

Most critical knowledge in industry still lives in:
- PDFs and procedures
- Experienced workers’ minds
- Informal decision habits

Digital Master aims to bridge this gap by converting human decision logic into structured, rule-based systems enhanced with AI-driven interaction.


## 🎯 Project Focus

This project explores how human expertise can be transferred step by step into digital systems that:

- Follow clear decision rules  
- Remain explainable and auditable  
- Support, not replace, human professionals  
- Operate in real-world environments  

The core idea is **Applied AI**, not abstract models.


## 🧠 Core Concepts

- Human decision modeling  
- Rule-based decision systems  
- AI-assisted interaction (Voice / Conversational AI)  
- Explainable and controllable logic  
- Real-world operational applicability  


## 🚧 Project Status

Digital Master is an **ongoing conceptual and architectural project**.

Current focus:
- System architecture design  
- Decision flow modeling  
- Knowledge transfer structure  

Implementation and demos will evolve incrementally.
